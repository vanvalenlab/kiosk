# DeepCell Kiosk: A Scalable and User-Friendly Environment for Biological Image Analysis

The DeepCell Kiosk is the entry point for users to spin up an end-to-end DeepCell environment in the cloud using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). It is designed to allow researchers to easily deploy and scale a deep learning platform for biological image analysis. Once launched, users can drag-and-drop images to be processed in parallel using publicly available, or custom-built, TensorFlow models.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

The scalability of the DeepCell Kiosk software is enabled by [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing). At present, the Kiosk is only compatible with [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), although [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) support is in development.

A running example of the DeepCell Kiosk is live at [DeepCell.org](https://deepcell.org). A [FAQ](http://www.deepcell.org/faq) page is also available.

## Features
- Cloud-based deployment of deep-learning models
- Scalable platform that minimizes cost and inference time
- Drag and drop interface for running predictions

## Getting Started

Check out our [docs](https://deepcell-kiosk.readthedocs.io/en/master/GETTING_STARTED.html) for more information on how to start your own kiosk.

## Related Projects

The kiosk is part of a software infastructure system built by the Van Valen Lab at Caltech. Refer to our [Software Infastructure Docs](https://deepcell-kiosk.readthedocs.io/en/master/SOFTWARE_INFRASTRUCTURE.html) for more information about how each repo contributes to the kiosk.
