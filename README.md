The DeepCell Kiosk is the entry point for users to spin up an end-to-end DeepCell environment in the cloud using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). It is designed to allow researchers to easily deploy and scale a deep learning platform for biological image analysis. Once launched, users can drag-and-drop images to be processed in parallel using publicly available, or custom-built, TensorFlow models. To train custom models, please refer to [DeepCell-TF](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-tf), which was designed to facilitate model development and export these models for use with the DeepCell Kiosk.

The scalability of the DeepCell Kiosk software is enabled by [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing). At present, the Kiosk is only compatible with [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

A running example of the DeepCell Kiosk is live at [DeepCell.org](https://deepcell.org).

## Features

- Cloud-based deployment of deep-learning models
- Scalable platform that minimizes cost and inference time
- Drag and drop interface for running predictions

## Getting Started

Start a terminal shell and install the DeepCell Kiosk wrapper script:

```bash
docker run -e DOCKER_TAG=1.0.0 vanvalenlab/kiosk:1.0.0 | sudo bash
```

To start the kiosk, just run `kiosk` from the terminal shell.

Check out our [docs](https://deepcell-kiosk.readthedocs.io/en/master/GETTING_STARTED.html) for more information on how to start your own kiosk.

## Software Architecture

![Kiosk Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk/mrgn-docs/docs/images/Kiosk_Architecture.png)

<tt><a href="https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-frontend">kiosk-frontend</a></tt>

- DeepCell graphical user interface built using React, Babel, Webpack.

<tt><a href="https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-redis-consumer">kiosk-redis-consumer</a></tt>

- Retrieves items from the queue and handles the processing pipeline for that item. Each consumer handles one item at a time.

<tt><a href="https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-bucket-monitor">kiosk-bucket-monitor</a></tt>

- The `bucket-monitor` will monitor all bucket folders listed in the `PREFIX` environment variable (defaults to `PREFIX: "uploads/,output/"`). Any files that are older than 3 days (configured the `AGE_THRESHOLD` environment variable) will be deleted.

<tt><a href="https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-tf-serving">kiosk-tf-serving</a></tt>

- Receives data from `redis-consumers` and runs model predictions on that data.

- Automatically and efficiently scale Kubernetes GPU resources
