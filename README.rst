The DeepCell Kiosk is the entry point for users to spin up an end-to-end DeepCell environment in the cloud using `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`_. It is designed to allow researchers to easily deploy and scale a deep learning platform for biological image analysis. Once launched, users can drag-and-drop images to be processed in parallel using publicly available, or custom-built, TensorFlow models [1]_.

The scalability of the DeepCell Kiosk software is enabled by `cloud computing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing>`_. At present, the Kiosk is only compatible with `Google Cloud <https://cloud.google.com/>`_, although `AWS <https://aws.amazon.com/>`_ support is in development.

A running example of the DeepCell Kiosk is live at `DeepCell.org <https://deepcell.org>`_. A `FAQ <http://www.deepcell.org.faq>`_ page is also available.

Features
--------
* Cloud-based deployment of deep-learning models
* Scalable platform that minimizes cost and inference time
* Drag and drop interface for running predictions

Getting Started
---------------

Check out our `docs <https://deepcell-kiosk.readthedocs.io/en/master/GETTING_STARTED.html>`_ for more information on how to start your own kiosk.
