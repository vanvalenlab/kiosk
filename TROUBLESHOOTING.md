## TROUBLESHOOTING

No piece of software is perfect, and academic software is certainly no exception. While we've done our best to make the Deepcell Kiosk robust to common use cases, we know that, simply due to the experimental nature of bioscience, users will inevitably push the Kiosk in ways we hadn't anticipated. We've tried to outline the bounds of the Kiosk's built-in functionality, but users might still end up facing errors whose origins are murky. For those times, we've compiled this Troubleshooting document. Hopefully your situation is addressed here. If not, feel free to open an issue on the Deepcell Kiosk repository (`https://www.github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk`).

#### My predictions keep failing and I have a lot of models (or model versions) in my `models` folder.
- You could be experiencing a memory issue involving Tensorflow-Serving. The solution is to reduce the number of models or model versions you have in your models` folder. Other possible solutions, listed in descending order of likelihood of fixing your issue, include choosing GPU instances which have more memory, using smaller models,or, if possible, submitting smaller images for prediction. In our experience, using n1-highmem-2 and n1-highmem-4 instances, we ran into issues when we had more than ~10 model versions total across all models in the `models` folder. Your mileage may vary based on a variety of factors.
