## helmfile sync has been failing a lot on GKE, due to automatic master upgrades immediately after cluster creation
## @helmfile sync || echo "Services couldn't be synced."
## what follow is a workaround
helmfile/create/all:
	@echo " "
	@echo "Syncing all Kubernetes resources using helmfiles..."
	/conf/patches/gke-helmfile-deployment.sh
	@echo "Helmfile deployment finished."
	@echo " "
	@echo " "
